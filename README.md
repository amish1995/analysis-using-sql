# ecommerce-shipping-analysis-using-sql

## Project Overview
This project involves performing data analysis using SQL on a sample of the E-commerce Shipping Data originally sourced from Kaggle. 

The dataset contains customer shipping records with attributes like - 
ID,Warehouse_block,Mode_of_Shipment,Customer_care_calls,Customer_rating,Cost_of_the_Product,Prior_purchases,Product_importance,Gender

## Dataset
Original dataset size: 10,999 rows, 12 columns

Working dataset sample: 1,000 rows (used for efficiency and faster processing)

Format: CSV

Imported into: MySQL Workbench

## Tools Used
Database: MySQL

Interface: MySQL Workbench

Dataset Source: Kaggle (EDA - E-commerce Shipping Data)

## Key SQL Concepts Demonstrated
1. SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
2. Aggregate functions: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT()
3. Subqueries (in FROM clause)
4. INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN
5. Index creation and performance analysis using EXPLAIN
6. Creation of views for reusable logic

## Files Included
 SQL script with analysis queries

 Sample of the dataset used for testing

 PDF document of outputs of each query

## Outcomes
Learned to query and analyze structured data using SQL.

Practiced performance optimization using indexes.

Built and tested SQL views and subqueries.

Strengthened understanding of joins and aggregate analysis.
